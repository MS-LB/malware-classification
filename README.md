# Classifications Strategies of Malicious Software

This report compares the different machine learning models for malware classifications using 2,4, and 8 attributes. We discuss the different models which include rule-based decidion trees, naive bayse, MLP neural networks and convolutional neural networks.


Abstract â€” In recent years there has been a spur in the growth of real-time detection of malicious software using analysis of hardware performance counters of active program threads on processors. The concept proposed by C. Malone., et al. in his paper [1]. The analysis originally done using Eurequa which is an A.I. modeling software to create a linear relationship. C. Malone, et al. expanded the concept of detecting software and software types to utilizing A.I./M.L. for real-time detection. Currently, the field has expanded to utilize tree algorithms, neural networks, rules based, or any other type of A.I. or M.L.
